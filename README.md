# 🤖 AI Interview Coach

An end‑to‑end **AI‑powered technical interview practice platform** that simulates real placement interviews. The system dynamically selects interview questions from curated JSON datasets, records the candidate’s verbal explanation using the **Web Speech API**, evaluates both **code and explanation** using **Google Vertex AI (Gemini)**, and provides **structured scores, complexity analysis, and actionable feedback**.

---

##  Key Features

*  **Smart Question Retrieval**
  Filters questions by **topic, difficulty, and company** from JSON‑based question banks.

*  **Vector‑Based Search**
  Uses precomputed embeddings to find the most relevant interview questions.

*  **Speech‑to‑Text Explanation**
  Records the candidate’s spoken explanation using the **Web Speech API** and transcribes it in real time.

*  **Live Code Editor**
  Multi‑language Monaco Editor (JavaScript, Python, C, C++).

*  **AI‑Driven Evaluation (Vertex AI)**
  Gemini model evaluates:

  * Correctness
  * Efficiency
  * Communication clarity
  * Time & Space complexity
  * Optimality of approach

* 📊 **Structured Interview Feedback**
  Provides:

  * Overall score
  * Category‑wise breakdown
  * Complexity analysis
  * Areas for improvement
  * Markdown‑formatted AI summary

##  Project Architecture Overview

The project follows a **clear frontend–backend separation** with JSON‑driven data and AI‑assisted evaluation.

## 🧠 Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express)

### 🔹 `server.js` – Backend Entry Point

The backend is an **Express server** responsible for:

* Loading vectorized questions from JSON
* Serving filters (topics, difficulty, companies)
* Handling question search & retrieval
* Sending candidate responses to Vertex AI for evaluation

**Core responsibilities:**

* Initializes Vertex AI using service‑account credentials
* Loads `questions_with_vectors.json` as an in‑memory vector DB
* Exposes REST APIs for frontend consumption

**Main Routes:**

| Method | Endpoint        | Purpose                                         |
| ------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/filters`      | Fetch available topics, difficulties, companies |
| POST   | `/search`       | Fetch a single best‑matched question            |
| POST   | `/search-all`   | Browse all matching questions                   |
| GET    | `/question/:id` | Load full question by ID                        |
| POST   | `/analyze`      | Send code + explanation to Vertex AI            |

---

### 🔹 `search.js` – Question Retrieval Logic

* Performs **vector similarity matching** over precomputed embeddings
* Applies filters:

  * Company
  * Difficulty
  * Topic
* Supports both:

  * Best‑match search
  * Full browse results

This design ensures **fast retrieval** without repeated embedding computation.

---

### 🔹 `judge.js` – AI Evaluation Engine

This is the **core intelligence layer**.

Inputs sent to Vertex AI:

* Candidate’s **source code**
* **Speech‑to‑text transcript**
* Question context (`judge_context`)

Outputs generated:

* Overall score (0–100)
* Category breakdown:

  * Correctness
  * Efficiency
  * Communication
* Time & Space complexity analysis
* Optimality judgment
* Improvement suggestions
* Markdown‑formatted summary

The evaluation is **explainable and structured**, not just a raw score.

---

##  Frontend Architecture (React + Vite)

### 🔹 `App.jsx` – Main Application

The frontend is a **single‑page React application** built for clarity and interview realism.

#### Key UI Sections:

1. **Header & Filters**

   * Topic selector
   * Company selector
   * Difficulty selector
   * Language selector

2. **Code Editor Panel**

   * Monaco Editor
   * Supports JS / Python / C / C++

3. **Question Panel**

   * Renders markdown question description
   * Displays difficulty & metadata

4. **Speech Explanation Module**

   * Uses Web Speech API
   * Live transcript display

5. **AI Evaluation Panel**

   * Scores
   * Complexity analysis
   * Improvement suggestions
   * Markdown‑rendered AI summary

---

### 🔹 Markdown Rendering

AI summaries are returned in **Markdown format** and rendered using `react-markdown` to ensure:

* Bold headings
* Bullet points
* Clean, readable feedback

---

## 📂 Question Bank Design (JSON‑Driven)

Questions are stored in structured JSON format, making the system **dataset‑agnostic and extensible**.

Each question includes:

```json
{
  "id": "dbms_12",
  "title": "Explain ACID properties",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "topics": ["DBMS", "Transactions"],
  "companies": ["Amazon", "Google"],
  "display_markdown": "...",
  "judge_context": "Key points the candidate should cover",
  "embedding": [ ... ]
}
```

This allows:

* Easy subject expansion
* Consistent AI judging
* Offline embedding generation

---

## 🔐 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file at project root:

```env
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./credentials/google-cloud-key.json
```

> ⚠️ The service account must have **Vertex AI User** permissions.

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

### Backend

```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:3000`
Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`

##  Why This Project Stands Out

* Goes beyond code correctness → evaluates **thinking & communication**
* Uses **real interview‑style feedback**, not generic scoring
* Fully **JSON‑driven & scalable**
* Clean separation of concerns
* Industry‑relevant tech stack (Vertex AI, React, Express)

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Interview session history
* Resume‑based question personalization
* Deployment on cloud (GCP / Vercel)
